# SnakeMic
This a project done as a part of the master's course Advanced Mechatronics (ME-GY - 6933) in NYU-Tandon, taken by Professor Vikram Kapila. This project was mentored and envisioned by Art visionary Professor Alejandro Moreno Jashes from NYU-Tish.

# Abstract
To alleviate a theatrical experience, a mic that can crawl around like a snake and speak when intended was created. In order to maintain the quality of the sound, a Bose SoundLink Micro Speaker was fitted into a mic-shaped chassis. With the help of an Arduino and a Bluetooth module, this Snake-Mic can be controlled using a user friendly Android App that was developed.
